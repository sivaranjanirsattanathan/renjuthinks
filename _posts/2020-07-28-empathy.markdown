There is an empty space,<br />
Too far to reach with this pace,<br />
What can be filled <br />
Is murdered and killed <br />
A possession owned by few<br />
A word not so new,<br />
If you think you have it <br />
Don’t hesitate to open it <br />
What the world needs<br />
Lies in your deeds<br />
Walk up to the emptiness <br />
And fill it with your lavishness,<br />
I am not talking about love,<br />
I am talking about Empathy,<br />
An act that’s being forgotten!<br />
