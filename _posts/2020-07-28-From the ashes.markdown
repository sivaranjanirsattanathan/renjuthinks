Wrong or Right<br />
The one that she wore,<br />
Fear and fight<br />
came through the door<br />


Happy was the time<br />
she roamed and rolled,<br />
Grown was a crime<br />
she turned so cold<br />


Time is God<br />
she learnt so hard,<br />
Integrity, a word<br />
she failed to guard<br />


Lessons she learnt  <br />
paved her a path,<br />
scars that burnt<br />
calmed her wrath<br />


All the broken pieces<br />
made into one,<br />
now staying at peace<br />
yet, deed not done<br />


She turned the pages<br />
to write her fate,<br />
little were the wages<br />
to reach this state<br />


Joy or sorrow<br />
she chose the right,<br />
down the narrow<br />
she grew so bright<br />


If life is a volcano,<br />
she is born out of fire<br />
Little did she know,<br />
She herself is a pyre!<br />
