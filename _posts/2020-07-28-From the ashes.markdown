<p> Wrong or Right  

The one that she wore,  

Fear and fight   

came through the door   
</p>


<p>Happy was the time  

she roamed and rolled,  

Grown was a crime  

she turned so cold  
</p>


<p>Time is God  

she learnt so hard,  

Integrity, a word  

she failed to guard  
</p>


<p>Lessons she learnt  
paved her a path,
scars that burnt
calmed her wrath</p>


<p>All the broken pieces
made into one,
now staying at peace
yet, deed not done</p>


<p>She turned the pages
to write her fate,
little were the wages
to reach this state</p>


<p>Joy or sorrow
she chose the right,
down the narrow
she grew so bright</p>


<p>If life is a volcano,
she is born out of fire
Little did she know,
She herself is a pyre!</p>
