##
Wrong or Right
The one that she wore,
Fear and fight 
came through the door 

## 
Happy was the time
she roamed and rolled,
Grown was a crime
she turned so cold

##
Time is God
she learnt so hard,
Integrity, a word
she failed to guard

## 
Lessons she learnt
paved her a path,
scars that burnt
calmed her wrath
 
All the broken pieces
made into one,
now staying at peace
yet, deed not done
 
she turned the pages
to write her fate,
little were the wages
to reach this state
 
Joy or sorrow
she chose the right,
down the narrow
she grew so bright
 
If life is a volcano,
she is born out of fire
Little did she know,
She herself is a pyre!
