<p> Wrong or Right  <br />

The one that she wore,  <br />

Fear and fight   <br />

came through the door   <br />
</p>


<p>Happy was the time  <br />

she roamed and rolled,  <br />

Grown was a crime  <br />

she turned so cold  <br />
</p>


<p>Time is God  

she learnt so hard,  

Integrity, a word  

she failed to guard  
</p>


<p>Lessons she learnt  
paved her a path,
scars that burnt
calmed her wrath</p>


<p>All the broken pieces
made into one,
now staying at peace
yet, deed not done</p>


<p>She turned the pages
to write her fate,
little were the wages
to reach this state</p>


<p>Joy or sorrow
she chose the right,
down the narrow
she grew so bright</p>


<p>If life is a volcano,
she is born out of fire
Little did she know,
She herself is a pyre!</p>
