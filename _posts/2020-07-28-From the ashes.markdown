Wrong or Right
The one that she wore,
Fear and fight 
came through the door 
 <!--more-->
Happy was the time
she roamed and rolled,
Grown was a crime
she turned so cold
 <!--more-->
Time is God
she learnt so hard,
Integrity, a word
she failed to guard
 <!--more-->
Lessons she learnt
paved her a path,
scars that burnt
calmed her wrath
 <!--more-->
All the broken pieces
made into one,
now staying at peace
yet, deed not done
 <!--more-->
she turned the pages
to write her fate,
little were the wages
to reach this state
 ---------
Joy or sorrow
she chose the right,
down the narrow
she grew so bright
 -------
If life is a volcano,
she is born out of fire
Little did she know,
She herself is a pyre!
