I"<p>The problem is, we expect. We expect someone to be a better person. We expect them to understand us. We expect them to be all that we want.</p>

<p>Shall we all just stop for a moment and look back at our life once. How many people we have missed because of our expectations. He didn’t understand what I said. She couldn’t adjust with me. He shouldn’t have got angry at me. She never informed me about her plans. Why? Why do we always expect.</p>

<p>Okay, what if someone meets all our expectation. We immediately want to make them our partner. Oh, that guy is so great, I wish he is my boy friend. Oh she is the kinda girl I always wanted, I wish she is my girl friend. We want to own them. Own their life as ours. And what happens after that? We get into relationship and ruin all the beautiful moments with our expectation again. Why?</p>

<p>Why can’t we just stop expecting and live in the present. Talk with someone. Enjoy the way they talk. Be happy when they laugh. Listen to their voice. See how they live their life. See how they connect with their family. See how they talk with their pet. See how they groom themselves. See how they walk. See how they dress up. See how they smile. See how they cry. See how they eat. See how they get angry. Enjoy the little things. Just be there. Hang in there. Don’t think about anything else.</p>

<p>Talk about music. Talk about books. Talk about their hobbies. Talk about their favourites. Talk about their work. Talk about their interests. Talk about their cravings. Talk about food. Talk about anything and every thing you want. Just talk. Compliment them. Cherish every moment.</p>

<p>People are beautiful. The level of their beauty depends on your perceptions. Make each and every person you meet in this world the most beautiful person you ever met. Let not your expectations stop them from being free in your world. Allow them to surprise you and in all those unexpected moments you will find joy and happiness.</p>

<p>Accept everyone as they are and stop expecting them to be who you want them to be.</p>
